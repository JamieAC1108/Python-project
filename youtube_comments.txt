Here&#39;s your message in English:<br><br>Hello, thank you for your excellent educational content.  <br>When I place the column of images in the <b>*Rows*</b> section of the pivot field, instead of displaying the images in the pivot table, it shows the word &quot;Picture.&quot;  <br>Could you please guide me on how to fix this?  <br>Thank you!"

@zahidahmed5384	2024-07-25T18:29:41Z	2024-07-25T18:29:41Z	0	hi, nice video as always. However, this is not working for me. I am using Microsoft 365/Desktop version and every time I try to do this I get only one cell with the word picture in it. Could you kindly suggest what might be the cause of this? For your information, I have added all the pictures in the cell with the &quot;picture in cell&quot; option from the ribbon. Thank you.

@Klarkooi	2024-04-14T12:05:55Z	2024-04-14T12:05:55Z	0	Hey Leila, thanks for all the tips! I am wondering do you have a video to show a simple scenario, when we create a pivot table, we want to attach additional columns of info from our original data sheet as companion info without making those data as computational (as we don&#39;t need it) or it will just expand into so many columns that is not useful. Appreciate your kind advice as run into such common needs very often. Now i need to use V/Xlookup to map the data column manually to maintain my overall readability of my pivoted details. Thanks~!

@michaeljarcher	2023-11-24T12:17:39Z	2023-11-24T12:17:39Z	0	"About time excel got with the picture. But first thing I tried was a use in power query, sadly this seems not yet ready for prime time.  DataFormat.Error: Invalid cell value &#39;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23value"">#VALUE</a>!&#39;. What a shame, gI uess need to wait to join all my data. (tears in the eyes). But appreciate the heads up on this feature it will be a game changer for dull lifless tables full of SKU&#39;s or partnumbers when the world is a visual beast."
@onewhitewolf13	2023-11-01T06:58:12Z	2023-11-01T06:58:12Z	1	Was this a phased release? My images are showing as text &#39;Picture&#39;. Anyone else have this issue? :(
