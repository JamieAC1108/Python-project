"No one read Haiku
A bad poem without rhyme
That is fucking dumb"

"crawling inch by inch
a life free of suffering
does it eat apples?"

"Have you seen my vape
I cant find my vape again
Never mind found it"

"The crescent moon glowed
Aliens are real, no doubt
Aliens like food"

"Basketball is fun
It makes me really happy
Go score some baskets"

"I swim in the deep
I feel so light like a leaf
I go up and breathe"

"Under the hot sun
We see butterflies flying
So do we see birds"

"I flew to Madrid
To see the Madrid team cook
And they won their match"

"greatest of all times
I did not knock that over
Soccer is the best"

"You count syllables?
Why should we care about that?
Okay, whatever."

"My eyes grow heavy
As blackened storm clouds grow near
Engulfing the sun."

"Fifteenth year in town
I feel like its different
I welcome changes"

"Five syllables here
Seven here and five below
This is a haiku"

"She is beautiful.
This whisperer to magpies.
She wore blue today"
